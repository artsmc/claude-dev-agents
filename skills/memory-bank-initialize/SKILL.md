# Memory Bank: Initialize

Bootstrap a new project with complete Memory Bank structure.

**Helper Scripts Available:**
- `scripts/validate_memorybank.py` - Validates structure

## What It Does

Creates Memory Bank structure in `memory-bank/` directory:

```
project-root/
└── memory-bank/
    ├── projectbrief.md         # Foundation (goals, scope)
    ├── productContext.md       # User experience & vision
    ├── techContext.md          # Technologies & setup
    ├── systemPatterns.md       # Architecture & patterns
    ├── activeContext.md        # Current work focus
    └── progress.md             # Status & learnings
```

## Workflow

1. **Check if exists:** Validate memory-bank doesn't already exist
2. **Create directory:** Make `memory-bank/` folder
3. **Create 6 files:** Use templates for each file
4. **Gather info:** Prompt user for initial project details
5. **Validate:** Run `validate_memorybank.py`
