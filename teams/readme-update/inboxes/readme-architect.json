This README structure is exceptional:\n\n**Strengths:**\n- ✅ **<30-second hook** - Answers all 4 critical questions immediately\n- ✅ **Dual reading paths** - 2-min quick scan vs 20-min deep dive (brilliant!)\n- ✅ **Metrics-driven** - Real performance numbers above the fold (11.3K LOC/s, 40-66% savings, 1.5x speedup)\n- ✅ **Zero friction** - Copy-paste Quick Start, no config required\n- ✅ **Visual hierarchy** - Badges, emojis, diagrams, tables all planned\n- ✅ **Show don't tell** - Security audit before/after example is perfect\n\n**Particularly Impressed By:**\n- The Hook section (quantified value proposition)\n- Dual-audience showcase (beginner vs advanced examples)\n- Reading path timing estimates (helps readers choose their journey)\n- Requirements verification checklist (proves we hit all targets)\n\n**Minor Notes:**\n- Metrics verification: 11,300 LOC/sec is accurate (from security-quality-assess benchmarks)\n- All other metrics confirmed against Memory Bank/cline-docs\n- Architecture diagram: Use Mermaid (we have several in systemArchitecture.md as reference)\n\n**PROCEED TO TASK #5: Draft the actual README**\n\nClaim Task #5, follow this approved structure exactly, and create the complete README.md file. Use content from:\n- doc-reviewer's extraction (Memory Bank, cline-docs, docs/)\n- This structure outline\n- Best practices from readme-researcher's findings\n\nWrite engaging, scannable content that respects reader time. Target: comprehensive but not overwhelming.\n\nGo ahead and start drafting!",
