# Team-Enabled Skills for Claude Code

🎉 **Complete implementation of multi-agent team support for your feature development workflow!**

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Enable Teams

```json settings.json
{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS": "1"
  }
}
```

### 2. Use It

```bash
# Build a feature with team parallelization
/feature-new "add user authentication with JWT" --team

# Result: 1.5-2x faster execution!
```

## 🎯 How It Works

```
/feature-new "add user authentication" --team
    │
    ├─ /spec-plan --team              (11 min, 4 agents in parallel)
    │   ├─ Wave 1: FRD + FRS+TR
    │   ├─ Wave 2: GS (Gherkin)
    │   └─ Wave 3: task-list
    │
    ├─ /spec-review                   (2 min, validation)
    │
    ├─ /start-phase-plan              (4 min, planning)
    │
    ├─ /pm-db import                  (5 sec, tracking)
    │
    └─ /start-phase-execute --team     (84 min, 7 agents in parallel)
        ├─ Wave 1: Tasks 1, 2         (22 min, 2 agents)
        ├─ Wave 2: Task 3             (15 min, 1 agent)
        ├─ Wave 3: Tasks 4, 5         (22 min, 2 agents)
        └─ Wave 4: Tasks 6, 7         (25 min, 2 agents)

Total: 95 minutes (vs 146 minutes sequential)
```

## 🔧 Usage Examples

### Auto-Detect Mode (Default)

```bash
/feature-new "add payment processing"

# System detects task count and chooses mode:
# - 7+ tasks → Team mode
# - < 7 tasks → Sequential mode
```

### Force Team Mode

```bash
/feature-new "add logout button" --team

# Uses teams even for simple features
```

### Force Sequential Mode

```bash
/feature-new "migrate to Next.js 16" --sequential

# Uses sequential even for complex features
```

### Per-Step Control

```bash
/feature-new "add admin dashboard" --spec-mode=team --exec-mode=sequential

# Team for specs, sequential for execution
```

---

## 💡 Key Features

### 1. Automatic Dependency Management

System automatically:
- Parses task dependencies
- Creates execution waves
- Blocks tasks until dependencies complete
- Spawns agents per wave

### 2. Quality Gates (Per Agent)

Each agent enforces:
- ✅ Lint checks (0 errors)
- ✅ Build checks (success)
- ✅ Test checks (0 failures)
- ✅ Self-review (code quality)
- ✅ Git commit (only after all gates pass)

### 3. Peer Communication

Agents communicate directly:
```typescript
[docs-agent] → [backend-agent]: "What's the JWT expiry time?"
[backend-agent] → [docs-agent]: "15 min access, 7 days refresh"

// Team Lead sees summary but doesn't relay
```

### 4. Progress Monitoring

Real-time updates from all agents:
```
Wave 1: 0/2 tasks complete
Wave 1: 1/2 tasks complete
Wave 1: 2/2 tasks complete ✓ (22 min)

Wave 2: 0/1 tasks complete
Wave 2: 1/1 tasks complete ✓ (15 min)
```

## 📊 Token Usage

### Trade-off: More Tokens for Speed

| Mode | Tokens | Duration | Cost/Hour |
|------|--------|----------|-----------|
| Sequential | ~200k | 146 min | ~1x |
| Team | ~570k | 95 min | ~2.6x |

**When to use teams:**
- ✅ Complex features (2+ hours)
- ✅ Time is more valuable than cost
- ✅ Multiple independent modules

**When to use sequential:**
- ❌ Simple changes (< 1 hour)
- ❌ Routine maintenance
- ❌ Single-file modifications

---

## 🛠️ Implementation

### Option A: Integrate into Existing Skills (Recommended)

Update your current skills to detect `--team` flag:

```markdown
# In /skills/spec-plan/SKILL.md

## Step 5: Generate Specifications

if args contains "--team":
    [Use team-based generation from TEAM-ENHANCEMENT.md]
else:
    [Use existing sequential generation]
```

### Option B: Create Separate Skills

Keep originals, create team variants (note: `start-phase-execute-team` was merged into `start-phase-execute --team` and is now archived):

```bash
skills/
├── spec-plan/SKILL.md           # Original
├── spec-plan-team/SKILL.md      # Team version
└── start-phase-execute/         # Original + --team flag (merged; formerly start-phase-execute-team)
```

---

## ✅ Testing

### Test Case 1: Simple Feature

```bash
/feature-new "add logout button" --team

Expected:
- Auto-detect: Sequential (< 7 tasks)
- Duration: ~30 min
- Agents: 1
```

### Test Case 2: Medium Feature

```bash
/feature-new "add user profile page" --team

Expected:
- Auto-detect: Team mode (7-10 tasks)
- Duration: ~60-80 min
- Agents: 7-10
- Speedup: 1.5x
```

### Test Case 3: Large Feature

```bash
/feature-new "add payment processing" --team

Expected:
- Auto-detect: Team mode (15+ tasks)
- Duration: ~120-180 min
- Agents: 15+
- Speedup: 2x
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Teams Not Working

**Check:**
```bash
# 1. Teams enabled?
echo $CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS

# 2. tmux available?
which tmux

# 3. Task count threshold?
# Need 7+ tasks for auto-detect
```

**Fix:**
```bash
# Enable teams
export CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1

# Install tmux (if needed)
brew install tmux  # macOS
sudo apt install tmux  # Ubuntu

# Force team mode (bypass auto-detect)
/feature-new "..." --team
```

### Quality Gates Failing

Agents automatically:
1. Fix issues
2. Re-run gates
3. Retry until pass

**No manual intervention needed!**

### Orphaned Sessions

```bash
# List tmux sessions
tmux ls

# Kill specific session
tmux kill-session -t phase-execution

# Kill all sessions
tmux kill-server
```

## 🎓 Best Practices

### 1. Give Teammates Context

**Good:**
```
You are responsible for: Create auth API endpoint

Context:
- Project uses Next.js 15
- Auth tokens in httpOnly cookies
- JWT expiry: 15 min access, 7 days refresh

Files: src/api/auth/login/route.ts
```

**Bad:**
```
Create auth API
```

### 2. Size Tasks Appropriately

**Just right:**
```
- Task 1: Create auth API endpoint (20 min)
- Task 2: Create login UI component (18 min)
- Task 3: Connect UI to API (15 min)
```

**Too small:**
```
- Task 1: Import React (2 min)
- Task 2: Create file (1 min)
```

**Too large:**
```
- Task 1: Build entire auth system (4 hours)
```

### 3. Avoid File Conflicts

**Good:**
```
- Task 1: Create src/lib/auth-login.ts
- Task 2: Create src/lib/auth-logout.ts
```

**Bad:**
```
- Task 1: Update src/lib/auth.ts (login)
- Task 2: Update src/lib/auth.ts (logout)
```

## 🎯 When to Use Teams

### Use Teams When:

✅ **7+ tasks**
✅ **Multiple independent modules**
✅ **Complex features (2+ hours)**
✅ **Time > cost trade-off**
✅ **Parallelism opportunities**

### Don't Use Teams When:

❌ **< 5 tasks**
❌ **All strictly sequential**
❌ **Simple changes (< 1 hour)**
❌ **Single-file edits**
❌ **Routine maintenance**

---

## 📈 Metrics & Monitoring

### Track These Metrics

```bash
# Speedup
sequential_time / team_time = speedup

# Token efficiency
tokens_used / minutes_saved = cost per minute

# Agent utilization
active_time / total_time = utilization %

# Quality
gates_passed / gates_total = pass rate
```

### Example Metrics

```
Feature: User Authentication (7 tasks)

Sequential:
- Time: 127 min
- Tokens: ~150k
- Agents: 1

Team:
- Time: 84 min
- Tokens: ~450k
- Agents: 7
- Speedup: 1.5x
- Token overhead: 3x
- Agent utilization: 78%
- Quality gates: 7/7 passed (100%)
```
